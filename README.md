Cooking Recipes
===============

Here you'll find my cooking recipes. I'd be pleased to hear about the experience users made
with implementations of these recipes. Developers are welcome to fork recipes and send in
merge requests. All recipes comply with our v13n (vegetarization) rules.

All cooking recipes are written by myself and are publicized under a Creative Commons License 
([CC BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)). Some recipes are forked from other 
authors' works, which is denoted in the appropriate places.

All recipes are in German for now, sorry.
